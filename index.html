    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      BilBareed is an outgrowth of the traditional greeting cards and invitations.
      in the current era where everything is becoming digitally organized, we
      can't see why greeting and invitations should be any different. the ability
      to deliver your feelings and emotions through E-Cards customized for different
      culteures and occasions is our speciality.
